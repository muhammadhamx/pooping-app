# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 22, 2026**

Throne ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") is a mobile application designed to help you track your bathroom sessions. We take your privacy seriously — especially given the personal nature of the data involved. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Account Information

The App uses **anonymous authentication** by default. When you first open the App, an anonymous account is automatically created for you. No email address, name, or other identifying information is required to use the App.

You may optionally:

- **Link an email address** to your account for recovery purposes.
- **Set a display name** visible to other users in chat features.
- **Choose an avatar emoji** to represent you in the App.

### 1.2 Session Data

When you log a bathroom session, we collect the data you provide, which may include:

- Session start and end timestamps
- Session duration
- Session rating (your subjective assessment)
- Notes you choose to add to a session

### 1.3 Chat Messages

The App includes real-time chat features, including buddy matching and group chat rooms. When you use these features, we collect:

- The content of messages you send
- Timestamps of messages
- Your display name and avatar emoji as shown to other participants

**Chat messages are automatically deleted from our servers after 30 days.**

### 1.4 Technical Information

We may collect minimal technical information necessary to operate the App, such as:

- Device type and operating system version
- App version
- Crash logs (if the App encounters an error)

We do **not** use any third-party analytics services.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely to:

- **Provide and maintain the App** — storing your session logs, enabling chat features, and displaying your profile to other users where applicable.
- **Improve the App** — understanding how the App is used in aggregate to fix bugs and develop new features.
- **Send local notifications** — the App uses on-device notifications (via expo-notifications) to alert you about session timers and engagement reminders. These notifications are generated and delivered locally on your device; they are not sent from our servers.

We do **not**:

- Sell your data to third parties.
- Use your data for advertising.
- Share your data with third-party analytics providers.
- Use your data to build marketing profiles.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### 3.1 Where Your Data Is Stored

Your data is stored using **Supabase**, a hosted backend platform built on PostgreSQL. Our database is hosted in the **United States (US East region)**.

### 3.2 Security Measures

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:

- Encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) for all data transmitted between the App and our servers.
- Row-level security policies on our database to ensure users can only access their own data.
- Anonymous authentication to minimize the amount of personally identifiable information stored.

While we strive to protect your information, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 4. Chat Messages and Retention

Messages sent through the App's chat features (buddy matching and group rooms) are stored on our servers and are **automatically deleted after 30 days**. Other users in the same chat may see your messages during this retention period.

Please be mindful of what you share in chat. Do not share sensitive personal information such as your real name, address, phone number, or financial information in chat messages.

---

## 5. Notifications

The App uses **local notifications only** (powered by expo-notifications). These are generated entirely on your device to remind you about active session timers or to encourage regular tracking. No push notification tokens are sent to or stored on our servers for marketing purposes.

You can disable notifications at any time through your device's system settings.

---

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App is **not intended for children under the age of 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided us with data through the App, please contact us at the email below, and we will take steps to delete that information.

---

## 7. Your Rights and Data Deletion

### 7.1 Access and Deletion

You have the right to:

- **View your data** within the App at any time.
- **Delete your account and all associated data** directly from the App's Settings screen. This action is permanent and removes all of your session data, chat messages, profile information, and account credentials from our servers.

### 7.2 Requesting Deletion

If you are unable to delete your account through the App, you may contact us at the email address below, and we will process your request within 30 days.

### 7.3 Data Portability

We do not currently offer a data export feature, but we are open to adding one in the future based on user demand.

---

## 8. Third-Party Services

The App relies on the following third-party service for its backend infrastructure:

- **Supabase** — database hosting, authentication, and real-time features. Supabase's privacy policy can be found at [https://supabase.com/privacy](https://supabase.com/privacy).

We do not integrate any third-party advertising networks, social media trackers, or analytics platforms.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. We encourage you to review this policy periodically. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
